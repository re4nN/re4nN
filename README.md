Hello, I'm Ryan, I'm 22 years old and have been passionate about technology since I was a kid. I love exploring new ideas and challenges. Currently, I'm focused on native iOS development.  
In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball 🏀, having a good cup of coffee ☕, and learning new languages. My English is currently at a B1 level, and I'm also learning French.
